                            At work we use Google tag manager to track a portion of our analytics and in some cases we send data to
                            certain groups for marketing. We came across a problem in which special characters were being encoded in strings
                            that were being sent to this group. There is a team that monitors and makes sure all data is being passed
                            without error. We received a report from this team that these encoded strings were throwing errors because the parser
                            simply doesn't like special characters. An example of the problem is below.
                        </p>
                        <pre class="blog-container-article__inner-container__section-sectionpre">

                        <h2 class="blog-container-article__inner-container__section-sectionheader">My First Attempt</h2>
                        <p class="blog-container-article__inner-container__section-sectionparagraph">
                            I checked the variable that was holding this string, and it was outputting with just the special character.
                            There was no encoding process being done so far with just the string variable itself, so I decided to remove
                            the special character before it gets encoded. Faced with this problem I thought it was going to be an easy fix,
                            just pass the string into JavaScript's replace method and have it match with a regular expression. In GTM I created a
                            Custom JavaScript variable that has an anonymous function with a return value of the variable being compared against
                            the RegEx.

                              I keep all characters that are letters, digits, spaces, and characters that are slashes. Everything that is not under
                              these conditions get replaced with "", meaning an empty string. After a number of tests I decided that it should be pushed into our QA environment.
                              The result I see next is quite unexpected by my overall low amount of experience.

                      Once I seen what my new variable was outputting, I scratched my head because they weren't consistent results with my prior tests.
                      Somewhere behind the scenes GTM encodes the string, even when the variable string I was replacing only had decoded special characters.
                      I had to abandon my way of thinking for me to come up with another possible solution. Stuck, I reached out to whatever I could find
                      online that would help me piece together a solution. To my amazement I couldn't find a problem in which someone needed to parse a
                      string and remove all HTML Entities in the way I needed them to be removed. I kept coming across problems were someone wanted to encode the
                      string values or decode each string character to its unicode value.

                    <p class="blog-container-article__inner-container__section-sectionparagraph">
                         Once I came to the conclusion that I was wasting to much time researching for a possible solution, I decided to come up with my own.
                         In the past I have created many algorithms in my past projects so I started with my general way of thinking to any problem.
                         That is come up with a solution that seems logically sound, and begin with a few comments to layout the ground work for my idea.

                      So far I like my route it seems like it could work if so long as the str I am receiving is in fact encoded.

                      The comments explain what the function is doing at the basic level. What I am doing is looping through the string finding
                      two indexes. One for the beginning of the encoded sequence of characters, and a second for the end of the sequence. If both
                      these values are strictly not undefined. Create two variables one that takes everything from the start of the string to the beginning of the encoded sequence.
                      The second will start one index past the end of the encoded sequence. I then concat the two strings into the new string with the encoded sequence
                      taken away. I restart the process for each instance that occurs in the string.

                      Further testing I seen a case were there is a continuation even if there isn't a &amp;amp; character present.

                      Then remove the contents from the start of the first &amp; occurrence and remove based on the new position

                      Now there are many ways of doing this problem, I am only using JavaScript's <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/slice">slice method</a>. I didn't find a need to get complex with my solution, because
                      the more complex you get. The more you sacrifice overall code readability. I took the problem at a pure
                      logical stand point. The process of reiterating through the string after each encode sequence is
                      very inefficient if the strings began to become massive. It would be awesome to see others take this problem and show myself
                      how dumb I really am. Now for efficiency wise the function call with my string passed takes just under a millisecond, and I
                      didn't find any strings with character lengths over 100 in my work environment.
                    </p>
                    <p class="blog-container-article__inner-container__section-sectionparagraph">
                      My main concern was finding a solution to the problem and that is what I did. In fact you could have this
                      be a part of the string object prototype, if you felt like you wanted to take it that far. I am happy I got a problem like this because it can challenge yourself,
                      even though it may be rather simple. It was a small victory in building my self confidence when it comes to programming. In the past and now I still go on sites
                      such as <a href="https://www.codewars.com/">codewars</a>, or <a href="https://leetcode.com/">leetcode</a> and practice. I feel you must have effective practice so you get comfortable with small problems like this explained above. Otherwise
                      you won't know how to handle such a task. I hope you enjoyed this brief read, and thank you.
