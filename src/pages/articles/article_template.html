                <h2 class="article-section-header">Getting Introduced</h2>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    When I began at Bon-Ton I was introduced to the systems I would be working with to push content onto
                    our site.
                    While I was getting up to speed with this process, the first project I was informed about was the
                    mega menu.
                    The mega menu was simply a drop-down navigation container that housed all the subcategories of a
                    main category.
                    The concept would be a user hovering over the category women and seeing all its relative
                    subcategories beneath it.
                    Right away this was a project that was exicting to me, not because it was just another development
                    project.
                    Its magnatude was far greater then any other project that I've built before. That's what was
                    exciting. The first couple weeks
                    on this project I began researching and figuring out how I am going to build this. To assit in the
                    build process, I used
                    a plugin called the <a
                        href="https://adobe-accessibility.github.io/Accessible-Mega-Menu/">Accessible-Mega-Menu.</a>
                </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    The use of this plugin was to add accessibility features to the menu, such as keyboard or screen
                    reader navigation.
                    This plugin was written as a jQuery module that you could initalize by calling its start method and
                    passing in an object
                    of classes. It would look for these classes and create a drop down like container with bare bones
                    functionality you would
                    see a drop down menu have. A major challenge I found in using this plugin is that its a custom to
                    having one layout specific
                    layout of HTML elements. So to combat this, I created that specific layout before initalizing the
                    menu with jQuery. This worked
                    like a charm and I was back in business on the development process. During the development process,
                    I had so many headaches trying
                    to figure out a test environment since I was the only developer on this project. At this time I
                    joined BonTon I was a Temp, and my mentality
                    overall was very stubborn. With this way of thinking it also lead to me being very unclear in the
                    descisions I needed to make, but along the way
                    I was able to spot this and reflect on it.
                </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    For a large duration of the project the test environment was on this website, where I would slowly
                    build the prototype to show my manager.
                    It was after the new year where I finished up a very primiative looking prototype, but it was
                    something that expressed that it was possible.

                </p>
                <pre>
Function
//returns Function() { [native code] }

Function.prototype.bind;
//returns bind() { [native code] }

Function.prototype.apply
//returns apply() { [native code] }

Function.prototype.call
//returns call() { [native code] }

function helloWorld() {
    console.log("Hello World!");
}

helloWorld.bind;
//returns function bind() { [native code] }
                        </pre>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    With this example you can see that the Function object has the methods bind, apply, and call. Then I
                    created a function called helloWorld, and checked if the newly created function has the bind method.
                    So let us focus on our .call method. For short helloWorld.call() and helloWorld() will return the
                    same result in calling the function. Why would you use .call then? The main reason is to create a
                    pointer for our this keyword.

                    <li>
                        Here I have three examples of showing you how you can use call(). You will get two different
                        results in strict, and non strict. The keyword this in strict mode will be undefined, and in non
                        strict it will point to the window object. In the first example, this is pointing to the value
                        of undefined. Then I simply pass a number as a argument, and now this is pointing to 20 in that
                        case.

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Once you understand the call method it's much easier then to understand the apply method. With apply
                    everything is the same compared to call except that when you pass arguments. They must be inside of
                    an array.
                </p>
                <h2 class="article-section-header">The .apply() Method</h2>
                <pre>

                </pre>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    The use of .apply is when a function takes a variable number of parameters. So instead of hard
                    coding a number of arguments in an array format, you can pass along an array variable. So instead of
                    passing 5+ arguments to a function you can just use the .apply method and pass a variable array for
                    the second argument.
