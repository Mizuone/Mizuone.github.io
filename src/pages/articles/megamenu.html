                        The megamenu was the first large project assigned to me at Bon-Ton. It was the first project that allowed me to possibility the
                        most as a developer overall. This project gave me the ability to understand cross browser and device compatibility at a fundamental level.
                        At the time I didn't fully understand git, which lead myself to version each iteration of the mega menu in a folder structure. Eventually after a few
                        months into development I pushed myself to learn git in a short period of time. Got comfortable in navigating a folder or computer's directories using the
                        command line during this process as well. Then towards my career at Bon-Ton I was exposed a high level of software design, such as design patterns.
                        The first few iterations of the mega menu was a spaghetti mess of functions and logic that really wasn't organized at all. Then due to this complexity, I
                        created a module to section the mega menu and give a sense of semantics to my logic. Enough of that, it's time to get into how the mega menu was built.

                  <h2 class="blog-container-article__inner-container__section-sectionheader">Build Process</h2>
                      <p class="blog-container-article__inner-container__section-sectionparagraph">
                        When I began at Bon-Ton I was introduced to the systems I would be working with to push content onto our site.
                        While I was getting up to speed with this process, the first project I was informed about was the mega menu.
                        The mega menu was simply a drop-down navigation container that housed all the subcategories of a main category.
                        The concept would be a user hovering over the category women and seeing all its relative subcategories beneath it.
                        Right away this was a project that was exciting to me, not because it was just another development project.
                        Its magnitude was far greater then any other project that I've built before. That's what was exciting. The first couple weeks
                        on this project I began researching and figuring out how I am going to build this. To assist in the build process, I used
                        a plugin called the <a href="https://adobe-accessibility.github.io/Accessible-Mega-Menu/">Accessible-Mega-Menu.</a>
                      </p>
                      <p class="blog-container-article__inner-container__section-sectionparagraph">
                        The use of this plugin was to add accessibility features to the menu, such as keyboard or screen reader navigation.
                        This plugin was written as a jQuery module that you could initialize by calling its start method with an object
                        of element classes. It would look for these classes and create a drop down like container with bare bones functionality you would
                        see a drop down menu have. A major challenge I found in using this plugin is that its accustom to having one layout
                        of HTML elements. I created that specific layout based on the documentation of this plugin before initializing the menu with jQuery. This worked
                        like a charm and I was back in business on the development process. During the development process, I had so many headaches trying
                        to figure out a test environment since I was the only developer on this project. At this time I joined BonTon I was a Temp, and my mentality
                        overall was very stubborn. With this way of thinking it also lead to me being very unclear in the decisions I needed to make, but along the way
                        I was able to spot this and reflect on it.

                      <p class="blog-container-article__inner-container__section-sectionparagraph">
                        With the plugin being utilized and the scaffolding finished I focused on my next task, which was populating
                        the megamenu with data. I created an few xml files to hold each sub category of each main category. We advertise
                        a list of featured brands and I created a separate xml file for those. To retrieve the information I used an AJAX
                        GET request. Then I looped through the xml file and for each group of in each category, I would created a list. This list
                        would consist of a number of list items. To organize each category based on the design I created a series of algorithms that
                        would help reach the design of the mockup to give a pleasing look to the overall structure of the megamenu. For example, if a
                        list had over 12 items it would split into two equal lists or close to. Another process would be if two lists were less than a few list items
                        they would merge into one. After each list was created and the categories were being displayed when hovered over, the first iteration of the
                        prototype was finished.

                        The mega menu had quite a long timeline. The iterations of development lead through my entire duration at Bon-Ton at certain intervals.
                        If we thought the project would align with a future release or during the downtime of one. Then that would be a perfect time to take it
                        out of the garage for a spin to make sure it doesn't fall a part. After the beginning phase of development. There wasn't much to touch up on.
                        Either it was making a certain function become a bit more performant or to slightly improve the user experience on tablet. The series of iterations went from
                        a number of mockups to eventually get down to a design that seemed clean and efficient to navigate. To making small tweaks is the visual display of
                        lists to the customer or there being less meaningless imagery. When it did get released in production for A/B testing. It performed rather low on tablet.
                        The reasoning we found in observing the statistics was that user's simply didn't know it was there. So our final iteration we wanted to have another test.
                        One being where the user gets notified that there is something here. Something that they can use to make their shopping experience quicker and smoother. Sadly
                        I wasn't able to get to see the results of this test because of company issues.

                        To summarize, this was a project that lead to a great success in my career at Bon-Ton. It gave me a purpose in moving forward in building
                        great features. The project lead me through the entire development process of building and consulting with others. This project laid out
                        the foundation at Bon-Ton and springed my development career. Thank you for reading this article. For more of my thoughts on the projects
