                <h2 class="article-section-header">The Start</h2>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    During mid 2021 I started to watch a youtuber called <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/@Miziziziz/videos">Miziziziz</a>.
                    At this time he was working on an FPS game called Wrought Flesh which was later released on Steam. To create this game,
                    he used an engine called Godot. Curiously, I started to look into this engine and got inspired to build an FPS game. I
                    saw he released a few courses on Udemy, which covered making an 
                    <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-make-a-retro-style-3d-fps-in-the-godot-game-engine/">FPS game in Godot</a>, and 
                    <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.udemy.com/course/how-to-create-retro-3d-graphics/">blender 3D character creation</a>.
                    After I completed the courses. I started to work on observing the mechanics you see in modern FPS games like Apex
                    Legends or Quake Champions. For example, I always enjoyed the movement mechanics behind Scalebearer in Quake Champions.
                    And wanted to see how I could implement the instant responsive directional changes. For Apex Legends, I wanted to see
                    how I could build a sliding mechanic into my game. From here I started to iterate over a period of months.

                </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Fast-forward to 2022. I went from iterating my FPS game to focusing on a third person RPG game. Playing games like
                    NieR:Automata and World of Warcraft Vanilla. Itched a part of my mind that wanted to see how I could mold these game
                    types into one another. For instance, NieR has a smooth fast pace combat system that allows you to quickly fight targets
                    and bunch from target to target effortlessly. World of Warcraft has this vast world and intuitive mechanics that pull
                    you into exploring each zone. On top of these game loops. You have the character development that incentives you further
                    into progressing through the world. For me, the sheer enjoyment came from building systems you would see in these games.
                    And bringing it to life in my game projects. Breaking down step by step and seeing how I can integrate the core
                    mechanics that make up these systems was what really pulled me further into game development.
                </p>
                <img src="../../images/initial_version_860x473.png" />
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    The above image is after a number of phases where I wanted to tackle each system at a time and bring everything
                    together. At this point I was able to create a basic world with questing, dialogue, character management and general
                    responsive movement. There are a few feedback systems as well. Such as a player HUD to give the player crucial
                    information when interacting with the world. This was the period after I started to realize bringing in paid assets
                    helped accelerate my general workflow as well. The way I use assets is mainly to provide a base mesh to allow myself to
                    modify further and theme it to my game. Another thing, it gave me a starting point in how to gauge quality. Seeing how
                    other people created models allowed me to upgrade myself and skip a large amount of back and forth on figuring out what
                    is correct.
                </p>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    Now at this point, I thought to myself. What part of the game is lacking as a whole, and what part of my skill set needs
                    work too? I decided the enemy AI in my game was really clumsy in the way it interpreted the player's actions. It also
                    had really low quality animations by me. I went and planned out the next phase of the enemy AI. How would it react? How
                    would it animate and so on. This allowed me to take my current knowledge of 3D rigging and push it to a IK rig. The main
                    mechanics behind IK, is to act as a joint structure for the skeleton. As you extend, twist, or contract. Your joints
                    allow you to move yourself in a fluid manner. I wanted my rig's skeleton to have the same kind of mechanics. So I began
                    learning how to implement IK into my basic rigs, and eventually I created a working rig that allowed me to replicate it
                    across all my characters.
                </p>
                <img src="../../images/blender_initial_860x473.png" />
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    After the animations, rig and model quality were in a good spot. I started to do some iterative development on the enemy
                    AI system. Basically I pulled everything that was essential to the AI and started overhauling. The pattern I followed
                    for the enemy AI was using a state machine to manage its current intention in game. These states encapsulated things
                    like idleness, aggression towards a target, and patrolling.
                </p>

                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    I followed this way of carrying out development towards my game on and off for the rest of mid 2022. Be it, I was
                    working full time as a Software Developer at Concurrency. So any free time I had I would devote to the game and
                    improving my current skills. From late 2022 to mid 2023, I started to pour more time into the game. Learned new tools to
                    help improve my workflow. Such as finding a realistic 3D character base mesh, and a new rigging add-on called Auto Rig
                    Pro. This allowed me to further push my capabilities and every two months I developed a sprint that would have a new
                    phase of the game. Be it improving existing systems to start handling new mechanics or introducing new systems into the
                    game. The next bit of information is my reflection from this period of development and a summary of what I've learned.

                <h2 class="article-section-header">Reflection</h2>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    The main starting point to answer from all of this is, is. What is hindsight telling me? Well, I would say that sticking
                    to an aesthetic and not uplifting it every couple months. Will save a ton of bandwidth to supply towards other areas.
                    Such as story, world, and character design. Saying to yourself, ok this is the graphic quality I am going to hit. Hit
                    it, and stay there without having the part of you saying. I need to re-do this. Now in terms of UI, I would argue. Aim
                    for getting something roughly implemented and come back with a new design. Then towards the polish phase, decide if you
                    want to revamp it or not. Also too, something I haven't tried yet is story driven development. Create an overall story
                    and develop the story while building the systems alongside. Going from a development standpoint of just building the
                    systems then coming to the story felt so foreign to me. It was so hard for me to interpret how to integrate my systems
                    into the story I wanted to portray. This can also be a good thing, because it aims towards a sandbox experience.Kenshi
                    and the old Elder Scrolls games do this very well. There are many examples to follow.
                </p>
                <h2 class="article-section-header">To Summarize</h2>
                <ul class="article-list">
                    <li>
                        Find a set of standards that you know you can achieve and stick with them. Alter as little as possible. Aim for a
                        balance towards functionality and quality.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Naturally follow your curiosity to allow you to build your skillset.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Stick to a genre you always enjoyed playing and work towards releasing games in that genre.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="article-paragraph">
                    With this cycle, you want to work towards quality in the long run. Volume in the beginning to learn the skills and
                    develop a solid workflow. As I continue my endeavors I will be writing more about this and see how my thinking holds up.
