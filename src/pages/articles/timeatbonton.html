                    Bon-Ton Adventure
                </h1>
                <section>
                    <p>Dec 16 2017</p>
                    <h2>Getting Introduced</h2>
                        <p class="articleparagraph">
                          When I began at Bon-Ton I was introduced to the systems I would be working with to push content onto our site.
                          While I was getting up to speed with this process, the first project I was informed about was the mega menu.
                          The mega menu was simply a drop-down navigation container that housed all the subcategories of a main category.
                          The concept would be a user hovering over the category women and seeing all its relative subcategories beneath it.
                          Right away this was a project that was exicting to me, not because it was just another development project.
                          Its magnatude was far greater then any other project that I've built before. That's what was exciting. The first couple weeks
                          on this project I began researching and figuring out how I am going to build this. To assit in the build process, I used
                          a plugin called the <a href="https://adobe-accessibility.github.io/Accessible-Mega-Menu/">Accessible-Mega-Menu.</a>
                        </p>
                        <p class="articleparagraph">
                          The use of this plugin was to add accessibility features to the menu, such as keyboard or screen reader navigation.
                          This plugin was written as a jQuery module that you could initalize by calling its start method and passing in an object
                          of classes. It would look for these classes and create a drop down like container with bare bones functionality you would
                          see a drop down menu have. A major challenge I found in using this plugin is that its a custom to having one layout specific
                          layout of HTML elements. So to combat this, I created that specific layout before initalizing the menu with jQuery. This worked
                          like a charm and I was back in business on the development process. During the development process, I had so many headaches trying
                          to figure out a test environment since I was the only developer on this project. At this time I joined BonTon I was a Temp, and my mentality
                          overall was very stubborn. With this way of thinking it also lead to me being very unclear in the descisions I needed to make, but along the way
                          I was able to spot this and reflect on it.
                        </p>
                        <p class="articleparagraph">
                          For a large duration of the project the test environment was on this website, where I would slowly build the prototype to show my manager.
                          It was after the new year where I finished up a very primiative looking prototype, but it was something that expressed that it was possible.
                          
                        </p>
                        <pre>
Function
//returns Function() { [native code] }

Function.prototype.bind;
//returns bind() { [native code] }

Function.prototype.apply
//returns apply() { [native code] }

Function.prototype.call
//returns call() { [native code] }

function helloWorld() {
    console.log("Hello World!");
}

helloWorld.bind;
//returns function bind() { [native code] }
                        </pre>
                        <p class="articleparagraph">
                            With this example you can see that the Function object has the methods bind, apply, and call. Then I created a function called helloWorld, and checked if the newly created function has the bind method. So let us focus on our .call method. For short helloWorld.call() and helloWorld() will return the same result in calling the function. Why would you use .call then? The main reason is to create a pointer for our this  keyword.
                        </p>

                <section>
                        <h2>The .call() Method</h2>
                        <pre>
//One example
"use strict";
function newWorld() {
    console.log(this);
}
newWorld.call();
//undefined

newWorld.call(20);
//20


//Second example
let Kyle = {
   example: function() {

        function passMeThis() {
           console.log(this);
        }
        passMeThis.call(15);
   }
}
Kyle.example(); //15

//Third example
function getJiggy(Will, Smith, spaceJam) {
    console.log(this);
    console.log(Will);
    console.log(Smith);
    console.log(spaceJam);
}
getJiggy.call("I am this", "I am Will", "I am Smith", "I am spaceJam");
//I am this
//I am Will
//I am Smith
//I am spaceJam
                        </pre>
                            <ul class="articleparagraph">
                                <li>
                                     Here I have three examples of showing you how you can use call(). You will get two different results in strict, and non strict. The keyword this in strict mode will be undefined, and in non strict it will point to the window object. In the first example, this is pointing to the value of undefined. Then I simply pass a number as a argument, and now this is pointing to 20 in that case.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The second example I explicitly tell the value of this to be 15 inside of the passMeThis function. If you wanted to, you could replace the number 15 with the keyword 'this', doing so will log the object itself.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    In the third example I created another function but this time I gave it 3 parameters. Then I call it using the .call method and pass 4 arguments, the first being a pointer for this.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                </section>
                <section>
                        <p class="articleparagraph">
                            Once you understand the call method it's much easier then to understand the apply method. With apply everything is the same compared to call except that when you pass arguments. They must be inside of an array.
                        </p>
                            <h2>The .apply() Method</h2>
                            <pre>
"use strict";
function getJiggy(Will, Smith, spaceJam) {
    console.log(this);
    console.log(Will);
    console.log(Smith);
    console.log(spaceJam);
}
getJiggy.apply("I am this", ["I am Will", "I am Smith", "I am spaceJam"]);
//I am this
//I am Will
//I am Smith
//I am spaceJam

                            </pre>
                    <p class="articleparagraph">
                         The use of .apply is when a function takes a variable number of parameters. So instead of hard coding a number of arguments in an array format, you can pass along an array variable. So instead of passing 5+ arguments to a function you can just use the .apply method and pass a variable array for the second argument.
                    </p>
                        <pre>
function concatString() {
    var combinedString = "";
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; arguments.length; i++) {
        combinedString += arguments[i];
    }
    console.log(combinedString);
}

var letters = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"];

concatString.apply(null, letters);
// abcde

                        Next lets wrap things up with the bind() method. This method is used to lock down the this keyword when defining a function expression.
                        Nothing we do on the outside will change its output, and it can only be used in a function expression. This is because when you bind it, you're binding to the function object that is created.

                        <h2>The .bind() Method</h2>

var lockedForever = function() {
    console.log(this);
}.bind("This function's this keyword is locked!");

lockedForever();

// This function's this keyword is locked!

lockedForever.call("new");
// This function's this keyword is locked!

                        I hoped you enjoyed my brief explanation and examples of using the three methods that allow you to stabilize the value of this in JavaScript. Good luck, and happy coding!
