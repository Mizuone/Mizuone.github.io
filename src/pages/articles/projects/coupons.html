                          The problem we faced was to reduce a customer's time in searching for deals across the site. A customer had no idea of all the current promotions we were running.
                          To combat this problem we thought of creating a page that is focused on displaying all of our site promotions. This primarily included shipping promotions and coupons.
                          Another considerable feature we wanted was for a customer to clip each promotion and have it automatically applied to their order on our cart page.
                          I was tasked with building this site feature and setup the environment for a customer to interact with.
                      </p>
                      <p class="blog-container-article__inner-container__section-sectionparagraph">
                        On the site there is a URL that stores all our coupon information in a JSON format. This was the point of access I used to output every available coupon our
                        new coupons and deals page. The framework I used to help me construct this page was <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/">Handlebars.js</a>. Handlebars is a templating
                        framework that allows you to create HTML templates with JavaScript objects. I created a template for the three categories of coupons we faced on site.
                        This was a in-store only, online-instore, and an online only coupon. Each category was a JavaScript object of coupons and I would loop through that object
                        to output each available coupon. The only downside I faced using Handlebars, was the limited amount of information regarding this framework.
                        Since it's rather outdated. If I came across a problem I wasn't understanding, it was difficult to research a solution. Luckily I was able to figure out
                        each issue I faced. The process was just frustrating due to the lack of popularity in this current time.

                  <h2 class="blog-container-article__inner-container__section-sectionheader">Cart Process</h2>
                      <p class="blog-container-article__inner-container__section-sectionparagraph">
                        This feature was to follow up on a customer's past action on the coupons and deals page. When a user clipped a coupon, that coupon's barcode
                        would be pushed onto a cookie. Then once they reach the cart, all coupons will be applied to the cart. Before a customer would have to manually
                        add each promocode to the cart. This automated that process, allowing the customer to quickly move along with their order. The cart page was probably
                        the most difficult problem I ever faced while working at Bon-Ton. On the cart page there is a ton of ajax events that get fired because the dom needs to constantly
                        be refreshed when an order gets updated. Everytime you update an item in your cart, an ajax event is fired. Refreshing a large container of elements on the page that
                        my script needs to synchronize with. With the coupons and deals update. There was a massive overhaul to how we deal with promocodes when it came to our imagery on the site.
                        On the cart page specifically there is a piece of creative or imagery that has a promocode being displayed. Before the user couldn't interact with the promocode but I created
                        a button that gets placed on the image. When the customer clicks that button, it applies that promotion to the cart. If they already clipped that coupon I need to visually
                        tell the customer that it's already applied. A similar update was made to how we handle freeshipping.
                      </p>
                      <p class="blog-container-article__inner-container__section-sectionparagraph">
                        When your order goes over 49 or 75 USD depending on the sale. It will show a container displaying that you're eligible to apply a freeshipping promocode. Well everytime your order gets modified
                        on the cart page. This container re-creates itself back to it's original state. This is primarily because before my update there is a large component on this page that handles the state
                        of the DOM in a certain container. I had no control over this state because this composer is built by a third party team of developers. I had only one option at the time, this was to
                        watch for an ajax event and update my contains to the correct state to match a customer's actions. This problem helped me understanding the firing of ajax events and made me utilize
                        JQuery's ajax event listeners. <a href="https://api.jquery.com/ajaxStop/">(ajaxStop)</a> <a href="https://api.jquery.com/ajaxComplete/">(ajaxComplete)</a> These two events were the bread and butter of my synchronize with this composer.
                        The process of automatically appending promocodes to a customers order was easy during the first iteration of the update. Once the update went into production there was one issue that raised
                        from an update to the composer. The composer wouldn't allow coupons to be added instantly to the cart. This process was throttled which broken the rate of coupons being added to the cart in my script.
                        If there were 10 coupons in the cookie I was looking for it would only output four coupons on average to the order. The solution to fix this issue was re-write the way I process coupons to the cart.
                        I used recursion after each coupon was applied. If a coupon was applied, in an ajax stop event I recalled the function. It will then proceed to apply the next coupon until all clipped coupons have been
                        added.

                      <p class="blog-container-article__inner-container__section-sectionparagraph">
                        Overall the coupons and deals update to the site was a major success. During the first phase of A/B testing in production, it served to be the 7th most visited site. Reaching on average 30,000 people a month.
                        There were other significant increases relative to the amount of money a customer would spend on the site. The simplification of our coupons on site helped a large number of people substantially.
                        The process before was confusing to track down every deal on site visually and know which promotion is correct. The project helped me gain a tremendous amount of experience not only in my JavaScript skills, but
                        for my problem solving as well. I faced a number of difficult problems that caused me to feel the anxiety of not being able to finish this project before our deadlines. Luckily I was able to
                        push myself through these mental barriers. Allowing our team to successfully move forward with this project and let this feature help our customers. Feel free to read about some of my experiences I faced on the
