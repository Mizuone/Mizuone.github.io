              I'm Kyle Orlinski. I bring with me a robust seven-year history in software development. My venture began as a
              front-end developer at Bon-Ton, where I specialized in web based design and functionality. As I progressed, I embraced
              towards a full stack development role as a consultant at Concurrency, contributing to the Modern Apps team. Alongside this, I've found immense
              satisfaction in indie game development, which I pursue part-time. Here, my focus is to blend my technical expertise with a creative
              intensity to craft captivating game experiences.

                      Started as an Associate Software Developer a part of the Modern Apps team at Concurrency in 2019. The first years were
                      working in team projects
                      mainly with Angular to build components and fixing bugs for clients. We followed agile using Azure Devops through out
                      each project big or small.
                      As I grew as a Developer, I started to work on projects with only a few developers. These projects I was responsible
                      for either building UI architecture
                      entirely or along side another developer.

                    <p class="paragraph mt-2">
                      After my promotion to a Software Developer in the company. I focused towards React based projects that were supported
                      using .NET and Entity Framework.
                      Here I continued to work on small team based projects. Towards the end of my Career at Concurrency I grew into a
                      fullstack developer that mainly was
                      competent using React with a Microsoft technology stack to support a application. Here I got rather familiar setting
                      up build and release pipelines with
                      Azure Devops and authentication support through Azure's B2C service.

                      My first professional developer job, in which I started as a temp for 6 months. The first tasks were getting up to speed with how
                      their ecommerce system is ran and what is needed of me. At the start I was responsible along with a few other developers to populate
                      the site with content to help aid customers in buying products using creative copy from the companies creative team. After I started
                      getting the hang of the workflow. I was given development focused tasks using JavaScript. The main task was creating a mega menu system
                      for their ecommerce site. Here I spent long hours each day powered by my internal drive to make a good first impression towards my career
                      as a developer. Eventually after months of iteration and testing. It was deployed and the rest is history. From this I began as an actual
                      employee at the company and continued with JavaScript focused projects to help give customers a easier experience in shopping the site.

                      This was a project that I started to introduce myself to Godot's 3D. That I continued to build ontop of over some time. Then I started to pursue working on the
                      project full-time in hopes of releasing it. I planned and tackled every system that felt needed to be introduced into the game. But as I got further and further
                      into the development, new realizations showed themselves to me. Ultimately I hit the point where I was stretched the capabilities of my tools to their limits.
                      It came down to the decision to move on or keep going.

                      My decision was to move on to a new project. Mainly because the first start of something you will be overly eager to start creating. New systems will be built,
                      progress is being made. Then you come to a wall of ok, now what? It almost felt like I was just building a system to build it, and not see it come fully into
                      life. So now, my main ambition is to find a set of tools that I can rely on to help build what I intend to fully create. Currently I am in the stage of finding a
                      new engine that I can use to help build my creations.

                      This was a project I worked on as a project initially when I was going to tech college. Over a couple weeks I followed tutorials on how to build an animation
                      renderer that would animate a character when using input controls. From here I went on my own path and tackled things like combat and progression. A small
                      amount of world design and UI using Canvas. Years after initial completion. I re-visited it with the intention to overhaul it using TypeScript. I took my 
                      knowledge at the time around 2017 and built my own engine ontop of HTML5's canvas.

                        Currently my goal when building a video game is to create a set of systems to work independently of one another.
                        Typically the systems will lay
                        on top of a grandeour entity such as a Character. The controls and game environment will act on these systems to be
                        utilized. For instance, if
                        I intend to have a looting system. Each component that makes up the system will be independent until a reaction
                        happens to sync the components with one another.
                        Typically in Godot and Unity I would do this using the Observer pattern. Which typically would have a built in
                        mechanism in the engine to use. When implementing
                        or calling.
                      </p>
                      <p class="paragraph mt-2">
                        Instead of listing a dozen systems and what type of patterns I use to build a game. It primarily comes down to what
                        will align with this goal of having each system be independent
                        up until the point of a reaction to give the player new information to continue the video game. As I continue
                        working on projects and publishing. I intend to refine
                        this understanding and possibly re-orient to a different way of approaching game architecture.
